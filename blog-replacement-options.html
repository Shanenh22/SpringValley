<h2 id="replacement-heading">Evidence‑Based Comparison of Tooth Replacement Options</h2>
<p>Whether you're missing one tooth or several, choosing the right replacement option is essential for chewing, speaking and preserving your jawbone. The three most common solutions are dental implants, fixed bridges and removable partial dentures. Each has distinct benefits and drawbacks, and the choice depends on your oral health, budget and personal preferences.</p>
<h3>Dental Implants: Durable &amp; Bone‑Preserving</h3>
<p>Dental implants involve placing a small titanium post into the jaw to act as an artificial tooth root. According to long‑term studies, implant survival rates exceed 96% after ten years and remain above 94% at fifteen years. Because the implant stimulates your jawbone, it helps prevent bone loss and keeps adjacent teeth from shifting. Implants look and function like natural teeth and don't require altering healthy neighbouring teeth. However, they cost more upfront, require minor surgery and several months of healing, and patients must have adequate bone and good overall health. Learn more about our <a href="dental-implants.html">dental implant services</a>.</p>
<h3>Dental Bridges: Quick &amp; Non‑Surgical</h3>
<p>A bridge uses crowns on adjacent teeth to support an artificial tooth between them. Bridges are typically completed in two visits and don't require surgery. They're ideal when surrounding teeth already need crowns and are often covered by insurance. However, they require filing down healthy enamel and do not stimulate the jawbone, so bone in the missing‑tooth area continues to resorb. Bridges generally last five to fifteen years before they need to be replaced. Explore our <a href="crowns-bridges.html">crowns and bridges</a> services.</p>
<h3>Removable Partial Dentures: Budget‑Friendly Option</h3>
<p>Partial dentures consist of replacement teeth attached to a plastic base that clips onto your natural teeth. They're cost‑effective and don't require surgery or altering adjacent teeth. However, some patients find them bulky or less stable, especially while chewing or speaking. Partial dentures need to be removed for cleaning, must be replaced every five to ten years, and they do not prevent bone loss in the missing‑tooth area. See our <a href="dentures-partials.html">dentures and partials</a> page.</p>
<h3>How to Choose the Best Tooth Replacement</h3>
<p>The right solution depends on how many teeth are missing, the condition of neighbouring teeth, your bone density, budget and personal goals. Implants offer the most durable, natural‑looking results and help preserve jawbone but require a higher investment and healing time. Bridges provide a fixed solution without surgery but may sacrifice healthy tooth structure. Partial dentures are non‑invasive and economical yet may feel less secure and need periodic replacement. Our dentists will evaluate your oral health, discuss your goals and help you decide which option will restore your smile and function effectively.</p>
<p>At Spring Valley Dental Associates we combine the latest digital imaging and 3D planning tools with years of experience to customise your treatment. We consider not only the immediate replacement but also how it will affect your bite, jawbone and overall health for decades to come. We're happy to share examples of successful cases to help you feel confident about your choice.</p>
